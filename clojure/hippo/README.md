Challenge description
You are required to write a web API with 2 endpoints:
1. A “Set timer” endpoint.
○Receives a JSON containing hours, minutes, seconds and web url
○This endpoint should return a JSON with a single field - “id"
○This endpoint should define an internal timer, which shoots a webhook to the
defined URL after the time ends (a POST HTTP call with an empty body)
○For example:
POST /timers {hours: 4, minutes: 0, seconds: 1, url:
"https://someserver.com"}
should return
{id: 1}
After 4 hours and 1 second, server should call
POST https://someserver.com/1
○The counter id should be appended to the URL, i.e.:
https://someserver.com/:counter_id
2. A “Get timer status” endpoint
○Receives timer id in the URL, as the resource id
○Returns a JSON with the amount of seconds left until the timer expires. If timer
already expired, returns “0”
○For example:
GET /timers/1
Should return
{id: 1, time_left: 645}
Additional requirements:
●The timers should persist.
●If we shut down the process and restart it, timers should be saved.
●If a timer should have fired when the server was down, the server should fire the web hook
after initializing.
Notes:
●Please use Python/ Javascript / Typescript / Java or C#.
●Please add a readme with clear execution instructions (solution will be tested in macos
environment).
●If you’re using another language, please package accordingly so we could install and run it
with minimum friction (ie packed in docker).
●Solutions will be measured by code structure and by their ability to handle large scale
(large number of timers).
●Feel free to add any extra functionality you wish.
●You’re welcome to approach me for any questions you may have.
